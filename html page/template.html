      <h3>Gabi Prefit</h3>
      <p> Hi! My name's gabi and I'm an aspiring game developer/programmer. Before bootcamp,
      I've worked on a multitude of smaller personal projects through the use of Unity, 
      and published two of these projects, with one of them even receiving first place in a 
      game jam. Apart from programming and making games, I also enjoy playing them in my free time,
      and I especially love finding glitches and bugs in the games I play, which then leads me
      to wonder how these programming errors came about. This sparked my curiosity for game
      development early on, and I hope that my passion for game development shines on
      through my projects!

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Sand Game</h3>
    <p>
	My bootcamp 2021 project, a Powder Game inspired interactive 
        sandbox, based on simulating two types of particles: sand, and water.
        This project makes significant use of classes and object oriented programming,
        as well as loops, array lists and light mathematics. The user can press the left
        or right mouse button to place sand or water particles, respectively. Initially, 
        more particle classes were planned, however the difficulty to implement them 
        grew exponentially, as they all had to have different behaviors when interacting 
        with every other particle class, as well as its own. Sand piles up on itself, 
        and sinks to the bottom of the water, thus pushing the water particles up.
        Water spills out onto the project area, taking the shape of its container,
        as it does in real life. Lastly, the game uses a grid system that can be scaled
        up and down and dynamically adheres to different screen sizes and different grid 
        resolutions.
